					<h3 style="margin:0;">Intro</h3>
					<p> This course introduces multiple methods to investigate cognition and behavior in natural settings. I learned about ethnography, videography (video data collection, coding, and analysis), survey design and conducting interviews, and how to move from observations to modeling. My final project is a research proposal for an observational study on how bilinguals are impacted by aphasia and the extent to which they recover their first or second language.
					As a bilingual myself, this topic was particularly interesting to me.</p>
					<h3 style="margin:0;">Question and Hypothesis</h3>
					<p>
						Aphasia is a common yet complex and multifaceted disorder that manifests itself in
						people with traumatic brain injuries. It is characterized by a loss of ability to understand or
						express speech, yet it does not impact other processes that relate to cognition and critical
						thinking. The focus of my observational study is to understand how bilinguals are impacted by
						aphasia and the extent to which they recover their first or second language. Specific research on
						how aphasia impacts bilinguals hold secrets regarding how multiple languages are stored and
						accessed in the brain, and may help develop better rehabilitation methods to help individuals
						impacted by the condition. Simply, the extra dimension of being multilingual when studying
						aphasia may offer new insights, benefitting our understanding of the brain's linguistic functions.
						Research to date has identified parallel and nonparallel recovery types, but no conclusions have
						been drawn as to what directly causes the variations in bilingual aphasics’ recoveries. This
						experiment will seek to study the extent and degree to which aphasics can recover their most
						used language after a serious brain injury, and tests if the frequency of language use impacts
						whether it is recovered. I hypothesize that bilingual people will score higher on the BAT and will
						show greater proficiency in whichever language they used the most frequently prior to the brain
						injury. As a bilingual person myself, I hope to demonstrate and learn about the nuances of the
						brains of bilinguals and how speech between languages is modulated in the brain.
					</p>
					<h3 style="margin:0;">Background</h3>
					<p>
						Research conducted thus far on the topic has documented the different types of recoveries
						that bilingual aphasics tend to experience. The two most studied are parallel recovery, where
						both languages recover simultaneously and to the same extent and selective recovery where one
						language recovers better than another. In either case, language abilities are diminished, though
						these effects can be uneven for bilinguals. The focus of my experiment will be on selective
						recovery and the process by which a particular language is recovered. Specifically, I want to
						understand if the most used language is the one that has a higher chance of being recovered.
						Before attempting this, I consulted previous research on the topic.

						<br /><br />

						Other research has sought to answer these questions and has yielded some statistics on
						how often each type occurs. In 2001, Franco Fabbro at the University of Udine conducted an
						experiment on the language recovery of 20 bilingual Friulian–Italian aphasics. Researchers
						conducted tests in both languages and found that thirteen patients (65%) showed parallel
						recovery where each language is affected, four patients (20%) showed greater impairment of
						their second language, and three patients (15%) showed greater impairment in their first
						language ( Fabbro, 2001 ). A follow-up study conducted by Michel Paradis at McGill university
						found that out of 132 cases published between 1990 to 1999, 61% of bases showed parallel
						improvement (Paradis, 2001). Despite these results, little has been found to explain why these
						findings occur. The native language, the most familiar to the patient, the most socially useful, or,
						still, the language of the environment has not proven to recover first or best. Nor does it seem to
						be a matter of whether the two languages were acquired and used in the same context as opposed
						to different contexts, at different times of development (Fabbro, 2001). The reality is, we still do
						not know how this process works, so to follow up on this study, I seek to look more specifically
						at the intricacies of selective recovery and how the extent of a language’s use impacts it.
						<br /><br />
						Several scientists have come forth with theories to explain how selective recovery works.
						In 1895, Albert Pitres studied selective recovery in patients and understood it using Ribot’s law,
						which states that newer memories deteriorate faster than old ones. Pitres suggested that a
						multilingual person recovering from aphasia caused by a stroke or cerebral injury will recover
						the language most used by the person prior to the onset of the aphasia (Pitres, 1895). This
						motivates my hypothesis that the most used language will recover to a fuller extent. Another
						suggested theory involves the control centers in the brain. Bilinguals are required to suppress
						whichever language they are not using, and are able to switch languages on or off ( Borragan,
						2018 ). If this control mechanism gets damaged due to a stroke or brain trauma, the individual
						will no longer be able to selectively control the use of one language over another
						<br /><br />
						Another proposed theory is the importance of emotional attachment to a language. Jürg
						Schwyter, a Professor of English Linguistics at the University of Lausanne got to study speech
						aphasia first hand after suffering a stroke. He explains that in his own experience that languages
						are differentiated based on purpose. Some languages are instrumental and necessary to get ahead
						in life, whereas others are integrative and invoke a desire to assimilate. Schwyter states,
						languages with high integrative motivations foster greater emotional attachments and are more
						likely to recover following the onset of aphasia (Schwyter, 2013).

						<br /><br />
						These studies into the mechanism of selective recovery give some background as to how
						aphasia works in bilingual people. This background research is complimented by my learnings in
						my neuroscience classes about memory. I learned in my neuroscience classes that long-term
						memories aren’t stored in a particular place and are rather distributed across the cortex. Our
						memories are reactivated over time and when we relive them, think about them, or dream about
						them, and we strengthen the connections in our neurons for these memories (Kiyonaga, 2020).
						By integrating this with the background research above, I believe there is a strong case to be
						made that selective recovery is influenced by how often a bilingual person used the language
						prior to the event
					</p>
					<h3 style="margin:0;">Validation</h3>
					<p>
						To ensure scientific validity, I have assessed my experiment across several criteria.
						Ecological validity refers to the degree to which the research addresses naturally occurring
						processes. Essentially, it looks at the degree to which the research actually maps real-world
						cognitive challenges. Our test takes ecological validity into account by including different kinds
						of aphasics in our tests. We chose not to discriminate our test subjects based on fluent or
						nonfluent types of aphasia. This makes our experiment more valid as it represents a wider pool
						of aphasics in the real world. We are also excluding aphasics that experienced their injury less
						than a year from the test date, as it is important to allow adequate time for recovery. We are also
						taking ecological validity into account by sampling the caregivers of our test subjects. The
						feedback from these individuals helps establish ecological validity as, for privacy and practical
						reasons, the subjects cannot be observed at all times. Their caregivers are therefore valuable
						resources to understanding subject behavior outside of the lab. Despite the fact we are
						conducting the experiment in a lab, we feel that the physical limitations of speech aphasia are
						identical regardless of the environment, and therefore our experiment should have a high degree
						of ecological validity.
						<br /><br />
						Construct validity refers to the extent to which our research highlights critical factors. It
						is a measure of whether the relationship between the variables we have chosen accurately
						highlights the critical factors we want to study. We made sure our experiment has construct
						validity by using standardized assessments for speech aphasia. Since the tests will be conducted
						in multiple languages, we want to make sure subjects are assessed for their language
						competencies relating to aphasia, not relating to their general knowledge of the language. If we
						created our own test, it might not assess language skills in the motor sense, and it may also be
						culturally invalid as translations may be used which would disadvantage certain subjects over
						others. Essentially, one of the ways we will ensure construct validity is by using a standardized
						bilingual aphasia test (BAT) that has been tried, tested, and implemented by previous researchers
						(Kock, 2019). We will also ensure construct validity by recording information about the type of
						lesion or other brain damage the subject has. This will help with construct validity as the area
						and type of lesion is important to correlate with the obtained results.
						<br /> <br />
						Content validity relates to whether our research instrument measures what it purports to.
						Essentially, it refers to the degree an instrument used in our assessment is representative of the
						target construct it should measure. In more simple terms, content validity refers to what variables
						we choose to score, and we want to make sure all relevant aspects of the construct are being
						measured to make sure our assessment is accurate. To ensure content validity, we want to be
						recording the media that matter. When it comes to aphasia, the most important data is the audio
						and video of the subject and their face, as well as all relevant data about the subject’s brain
						damage and habits. We also want to know the type of brain damage, when it occurred, and any
						symptoms aside from aphasia. To ensure content validity we will record the subjects from
						multiple camera angles to watch for body movements and both cameras will be recording audio
						for redundancy. To ensure content validity, we will make sure our subject group contains a large
						enough sample and that will not be misled by outliers. Lastly, we will review the work of other
						researchers and experts on aphasia to ensure we record any other variables that are important in
						understanding the construct.
						<br /> <br />
						Predictive validity refers to whether our experiment produces a reliable predictive
						relationship between the variables. Essentially, it measures whether the findings of our study are
						valid when it comes to making generalized assumptions from the results. For our test, this
						represents whether the findings of our study can be used to predict the language ability and
						recovery of future bilingual aphasics. To establish predictive validity, we will run a two-tailed
						hypothesis test. Our null hypothesis is that whichever language is used the most will be
						recovered to a greater extent than the latter. Our alternative hypothesis is that the language most
						commonly used has no effect on the language that is recovered. Our significance level for the
						test will be 0.05. We predict that the language used most commonly will recover better than the
						latter and that this difference will be noticeable based on the latency, rate of speech, and results
						of the bilingual aphasia test (BAT) for each language.
					</p>
					<h3 style="margin:0;">Methods</h3>
					<p>
						A single-subject group with fifty participants will be created for the study. It includes
						bilingual aphasics with different kinds of aphasia. The onset of the aphasia must have been more
						than a year before the test. We will include aphasics of varying recovery times from one year to
						ten years
						<br /> <br />
						The test subjects will be observed completing a series of simple tasks in a lab room. The
						participants will be evaluated by a standardized bilingual aphasia test to avoid problems with
						translations that would impede the validity of the test. The translation of stimulus items may be
						culturally inappropriate, culturally incorrect words may be used to describe objects, and these
						could skew the test by making it more difficult to understand in certain languages. The
						standardized bilingual aphasia test includes the reading of words, sentences, as well as
						paragraphs. It includes reading comprehension, naming, sentence repetition, pointing, as well as
						tests with synonyms and antonyms. The second part of the test will be an object recognition task
						designed to assess whichever language comes fastest. Participants will be asked to name simple
						everyday objects that appear on a screen in front of them. Participants will be asked to name the
						object displayed in one language, then the latter in order to evaluate differences in response times
						based on the language used.

						<br /><br />
						To collect data on our test, we will record the participants on video from two separate
						angles. The first will be framed around the participant’s face and upper torso with light properly
						illuminating the subject. The second camera will be placed further away to record the subject’s
						body language. Both cameras will be recording audio as well as video. The researcher will also
						complete an in-situ checklist evaluating the abilities of the test subject. This checklist will be the
						same for all participants and will be filled out for each test by the supervising researcher. In
						addition to the data recorded during the test, a host of other data points will be collected about
						the subject. We will collect the medical history, details about the cause of the aphasia as well as
						the brain damage. Most importantly, we will be recording information about the subject’s
						bilingual speaking habits, including which language they learned first, which language they used
						the most, which language they associate to what things (be it work, or personal life), and how
						their bilingualism has changed since the onset of aphasia. To further our ecological validity, we
						will be recording the observations of a third-party caretaker to gather their understanding of the
						subject’s speaking habits at home, and how these have changed since the onset of aphasia.

						<br /><br />
						To analyze our data, we will be using several measures. First, the subjects will have their
						scores on the bilingual aphasia test calculated and scored. We will pair these with the audio and
						video of the test in which we will be measuring differences in latency and rate of speech between
						the two languages to create time-series data. We will do the same thing for the object recognition
						task. The results of our experiment will be aggregated with the data we have collected on the
						bilingual speech habits of each subject before and after the onset of aphasia. We will analyze it
						for any trends and would expect to see lower latencies and higher rates of speech for whichever
						language the subject used more. In regards to the object recognition test, we expect subjects to be
						faster at naming the objects in whichever language they used more frequently before the onset of
						aphasia.
						<h3 style="margin:0;">The Role of Time</h3>
						As we learned in lecture, any description of human cognitive activities must include
						multiple timescales. Studying speech aphasia as a topic is interesting because it has these
						multiple scales. On the micro-scale, we are studying the very nerve impulses in the brain that are
						sending signals to create speech. On the macro scale, we are studying bilinguals with brain
						damage to understand how they recover from aphasia. On the historic scale, we are learning
						about the brain’s language functions by investigating what happens when different parts of it get
						damaged, and how it is able to recover from this damage years after it occurs. Looking at our lab,
						time manifests itself on all of these scales as and it is one of the variables that we will score. We
						investigate the micro-scale in the potential millisecond latency differences we may find between
						the subject’s speech in different languages. We may also study this micro-scale in the number of
						words a person speaks per second between different languages, and it will manifest itself in the
						latency between object recognition in either language. We can understand macro-level patterns
						by creating time-series data and analyzing the differences in this data between different people.
						We might also gather macro-level data about the subject’s long-term term speech habits by
						surveying the caretakers with whom they spend the most time. Historically, this study could
						teach us about how the brain modulates multiple languages, how different areas of the brain are
						responsible for different aspects of speech, and how the brain is able to repurpose itself in the
						recovery of brain damage like aphasia. The adaptive engagement between the brain and its
						environment takes place over a large period of time. To properly assess this, it needs to be looked
						at using multiple timescales, which therefore means that no study has all the answers, and it takes
						cumulative research to understand issues on the longer term. When we put these multiple
						timescales together, it is easier to picture and understand the scope of the study through all the
						levels, all the way from the millisecond time differences we observe to how this fits into the
						larger puzzle. This study would be a tiny piece of the puzzle, but our results could be important
						in how we understand language, memory, and bilingualism.
