					<h3 style="margin:0;">Moving Towards Positive Depictions of War Induced PTSD</h3>
					<p>
						Contemporary popular culture tends to glorify war and ignore the mental health traumas
						that soldiers face when coming home. For many veterans, a second battle begins as they go back
						to civilian life, and for some it can be more challenging than being deployed. Most of our
						conceptions of war come from how it's defined in pop culture. Nations decorate their war
						veterans as heroes, Hollywood producers show glorified soldiers that win against all odds, and
						video games like Call of Duty depict war as inconsequential, thrilling, and fun. These depictions
						omit and ignore the long term psychological damages that soldiers must manage, like PTSD.
						PTSD is a leading mental health condition that soldiers are affected by during and after
						deployment. It tends to manifest itself mildly but can be severe and extremely debilitating for
						some individuals, leaving them with work or sleep problems (McNulty). For some, PTSD
						symptoms improve, but for others, it is a lifelong condition that is a true disability and for which
						benefits are available. This reality never quite makes it to pop culture’s depictions of war, which
						distorts how soldiers and the public perceive the seriousness of PTSD and the services we make
						available to treat it.
						<br /> <br />
						Understanding this is important because media portrayals of soldiers have a powerful
						effect on how veterans are perceived. Studying misconceptions helps shed light on the real costs
						of war, the ways we can better help veterans, and how we can better treat PTSD as a condition.
						American Sniper fits into this as a recent war film that portrays PTSD in a nuanced and accurate
						way. As a biographical film, its depiction of the protagonist Chris Kyle sets itself apart from
						other war movies by giving a detailed glimpse at the reintegration process and the realities for
						soldiers and their families as they recover. It sets a standard for other depictions in pop culture
						and I will be explaining its significance. My essay will prove that Portrayals of war in pop
						culture are misleading and negatively influence the ways the public perceives veterans with
						mental health conditions. These depictions need change to improve the health and reintegration
						experiences of veterans returning from combat. I will show how American Sniper makes
						headway towards this goal through its accurate and nuanced depiction of postwar reintegration.
						American Sniper is unique because it is not primarily a film about mental health. It is in every
						way a true war movie, with the gore and explosions that keep audiences on edge. Even with
						these, it finds time to positively show mental health with a realistic timeline and a nuanced
						portrayal that positively impacts audiences. I’ll begin by leveraging Maseda’s paper to explain
						how portrayals of war in pop culture omit and misrepresent PTSD as a condition, then I’ll use
						Vassar and Libermann’s papers to show how this twists the public’s perception about the
						condition’s seriousness, as well as its treatability. The next part of my paper will use Freyes,
						Fisher, and Vassar to show how Pop culture’s negative impact on PTSD can be ameliorated by
						including PTSD in war stories and by showing available mental health resources to normalize
						recovery. The mentioned sources and others will set the stage to show how American Sniper
						fulfills these and goes even further with its nuanced and detailed depiction of PTSD.
						<br /> <br />
						Portrayals of war in pop culture omit and misrepresent PTSD as a condition, which
						negatively influences veterans and the public about the condition’s seriousness as well as its
						treatability. Pop culture depictions of war tend to ignore or misrepresent mental health conditions
						because they are less entertaining. The most common way pop culture misrepresents PTSD is by
						ignoring the condition and not letting it have a spot in public discourse. To get the obvious out of
						the way, it must be said that PTSD generally does not lend itself well for the big screens. From
						the perspective of the entertainment industry, eye catchy explosions and tense combat scenes are
						more interesting and get more views than showing vets at PTSD counseling. The reality is that
						depicting PTSD, especially in an honest and informative way, is not normally something that
						sells in Hollywood or that gets views on social media. This limitation is important to keep in
						mind, as it gives context as to why war depictions are so common and yet why PTSD depictions
						of veterans are not.
						<br /> <br />
						The slow pace at which PTSD has entered public discourse and been recognized and
						researched by the academic community has contributed to pop culture depictions ignoring or
						misrepresenting the condition. Outside of the incentives Hollywood producers have to ignore
						PTSD in favor of other more intense, or visually pleasing elements of war, the portrayal of vets
						with the condition has been influenced by the slow pace at which PTSD has entered public
						discourse. As is explained by Maseda, PTSD was only officially recognized in 1980, which is
						significant because this is extremely late. It is well known that other conditions ranging from
						schizophrenia, autism, or bipolar disorder were discovered much earlier in the 19th and early
						20th centuries, several decades or even over a century before PTSD. Worse is that the condition
						has surely affected those exposed to war traumas for thousands of years, and even worse is that it
						seems pop culture has identified the condition before researchers have, with the existence of
						nicknames for PTSD like “nostalgia” during the civil war, “battle neurosis” during WWI, and
						“shell shock” during WWII (3). This means that the vast majority of American combat veterans
						were deployed before the condition was understood, and it also means that pop culture depictions
						of PTSD have existed long before any research was available (see graphic on page 13). Although
						there are reasons for this, politically and otherwise, it is clear that this has had an effect on how
						war induced PTSD has been portrayed in pop culture. As Maseda explains, “Hollywood movies
						prior to 1970 portrayed earlier wars’ veterans mainly with physical problems” and “their
						physical problems ‘overshadowed the usually more subtle and secondary psychological issues’”
						(6). Even when mental health conditions were shown, they tended to be tamed, where soldiers
						shown in films “either didn’t suffer from serious psychological problems or, if they did, their
						problems were ameliorated by a warm homecoming” (7). Put simply, pop culture depictions
						throughout the 20th century have turned a blind eye to how veterans are impacted by mental
						health conditions. Most depictions focus on physical ailments, and those that show mental health
						conditions show them as an afterthought. This can be attributed to the very late recognition and
						research, since it cannot be expressed how late the year 1980 is to officially recognize such a
						significant condition. This has forced PTSD into the back seat in our depictions of war, which
						ultimately stigmatizes the condition and downplays how serious and widespread it is.
						<br /> <br />
						The obscurity around PTSD has factored in pop culture’s misrepresentations of the
						condition through stereotypes and sensationalized character development. The extremely late
						recognition for PTSD has created a void which pop culture has creatively filled with
						entertainment and sensationalism. One of the common ways this happens is with blatantly
						incorrect symptom portrayals. As Maseda explains: soldiers were “sometimes portrayed as
						suffering from catatonia following a traumatic battle, which is a highly unusual response to
						psychological trauma” (6). Beyond incorrect symptom depictions, Maseda explains the trend in
						pop culture to show the “intolerance and hardship of military culture towards psychological
						breakdowns” (7). This has connoted PTSD to weakness, which undermines vets and the
						condition. Potentially worse, as Maseda explains, are the fixations of Hollywood producers to
						create deranged or violent characters, and how producers have leveraged the returning war
						veteran as a stereotype to achieve this (12). Cheaply produced, sensational films like Born Losers
						(1967), Angels From Hell (1968), and Chrome and Hot Leather (1971) showed drugs, violence,
						and chaos by representing veterans as psychotic, gun-crazed loners” (10). These pumped up
						versions of PTSD ridicule its seriousness and make it hard for the public to understand it
						truthfully. This is a big deal, because as Vassar explains in his study, “It is known that distorted
						images of mental health in the media …can lead to misinformation” (qtd. in Vassar 579). It is
						clear that the associations to weakness and to psychotic, dehumanized characters are distorted
						and do in fact mislead the public. This brief history is important to keep in mind, because it gives
						context as to why pop culture has been so poor at showing mental health conditions associated
						with war.
						<br /> <br />
						In sum, pop culture depictions of war tend to ignore or misrepresent mental health
						conditions because they are less entertaining and because of the slow pace at which PTSD has
						been recognized and researched by the academic community. Pop culture went first, with
						decades of misrepresentations through stereotypes and sensationalized character development
						which has spread misinformation. The result of this is that PTSD is downplayed, and the public
						is kept in the dark, which ultimately harms vets and their outcomes.
						<br /> <br />
						Pop culture’s negative impact on PTSD can be ameliorated by including PTSD in war
						stories and by showing available mental health resources to normalize recovery, to inform the
						public about the condition, and to raise awareness about treatment choices. The entertainment
						industry negatively influences the public about vets with mental health conditions but is in a
						strong position to make a difference. A very small percentage of voting Americans are war
						veterans, and even fewer are geared to understand PTSD in its fullness. Many people’s grasp on
						PTSD is shaped by pop culture and by social media. In the self-reported section in Libermann’s
						survey, it was found that “nearly half the population reports that the entertainment industry has a
						very big impact on the way people perceive veterans (6). Somewhat alarmingly, the survey
						results showed “Americans believe that veterans are more likely to carry negative attributes than
						an average civilian, in opposition to reality” and that “the biggest misconception comes on the
						issue of mental health–more than 8 in 10 believe post 9/11 veterans are more likely to suffer
						from mental health issues than a comparable civilian (4). To tie these findings together, the
						survey found that pop culture is highly influential on our views of veterans, that generally, the
						public thinks veterans are portrayed more negatively than positively ( 6). These findings show
						that the public makes a lot of poor assumptions about vets and holds the entertainment industry
						accountable. The alarming rates at which the public associates veterans with mental health
						conditions is strong evidence that pop culture portrayals could do better.
						<br /> <br />
						PTSD needs to be a bigger part of how we tell war stories so that the public is better
						informed about the condition, its symptoms, and its seriousness. As explained, media portrayals
						have a tremendous impact on how the veterans and the public perceive mental health, and PTSD
						needs to be included in the conversation. As Vassar explains in his study, PTSD is common and
						widespread, with “approximately 11% to 20% of veterans who served in Operation Iraqi
						Freedom and Enduring Freedom, 12% who served in the gulf war, and 15% who served in the
						vietnam war have been diagnosed with PTSD” (579). These are big proportions of our veterans,
						especially considering the high number of vets who are potentially undiagnosed. Despite how
						common the condition is, it is clear there is a void in the public’s understanding of it. Vets in the
						VA network who were surveyed in Fisher said they wished PTSD was more talked about:
						“Veterans … focused most heavily on getting information about PTSD to their family
						members. Comments like this one from a male veteran were common: ‘Pretty Much
						everybody needs to understand what PTSD is....You Gotta understand it in order to
						help.’” (Fischer 190)
						<br /> <br />
						Vets were not the only ones who wished there was more awareness about the condition. Family
						members who were surveyed explained what they too wished they had known more:
						The fiancé of one veteran said, “I wish I would have known what PTSD was....For a long
						period of time I thought that was an excuse he was using, you know, not to do things.”
						The cousin of another veteran remarked that “. . . the kids....need some education on
						it....someone else to tell the symptoms and tell, you know, what could happen and how to
						deal with it.”
						<br /> <br />
						These scenarios show that there is a lack of PTSD awareness both within the military and in the
						public. As this makes evident, PTSD needs to be a part of how we think of war, and simply
						choosing to include PTSD in pop culture would have a positive effect on reintegration
						experiences. Recovering from PTSD involves tremendous change which can be overbearing and
						made worse by vets and family members who don’t understand or don’t take the condition
						seriously. For the benefit of our vets, pop culture needs to normalize PTSD as a war injury the
						same way we do physical ailments
						because as established, media portrayals of soldiers with mental health conditions have a big
						impact on how veterans and the public perceive those conditions. By ignoring PTSD recovery,
						media portrayals limit how people perceive the condition and the resources available for it.
						Academia has found that leveraging resources and seeking professional help is important for
						successful recoveries. As established in Freyes et Al: “To some extent, several couples credited
						their outcomes to the help or guidance received from professional sources. The only regret some
						expressed was not seeking help sooner” (153). A lot of vets don’t find this help sooner because
						they don’t know about the resources available to help them. In American Sniper, Chris Kyle
						finds the recovery group as a last resort when a doctor shows him where it is. Studies echo this
						and show that vets wished they knew more about treatment options and support networks.
						According to the Fisher study, “About a third of veterans also expressed a desire for information
						about current VA services and benefits, as well as how VA healthcare programs operate and
						communicate internally: “It’s like you need a PhD in just Veterans Affairs [to figure out what
						services are available]....every time you look around, it’s like we used to do, oh, no, it’s not like
						that now’” (190). More focus should also be paid to resources available to the family members of
						veterans that have PTSD. As is explained in Fisher, VA resources should expand resources for
						family members and children: “The need for skills training to help families living with a person
						with PTSD was mentioned most frequently by both veterans and family members” (Fisher 190).
						Receiving care greatly benefits outcomes and receiving care depends on the attitudes and
						perceptions vets have about care. Pop culture depictions of war, whether they be movies, tv
						shows, or posts on social media, are in a unique place to make a difference.
						<br /> <br />
						American Sniper's nuanced and detailed depiction of PTSD makes great headway
						towards more honest and neutral portrayals of mental health. Future war films should take note.
						American Sniper accurately depicts PTSD symptoms and how they impact members of a
						veteran's family during reintegration. As a biographical film, it goes into more detail about the
						reintegration process. The lengthy part about Chris Kyle’s reintegration experience featured
						scenes that felt uncomfortably real and which research confirms are accurate. According to the
						APA, “PTS symptoms are divided into four clusters—intrusive recollections, avoidance,
						negative alterations in cognitions/mood, and arousal—and include features such as emotion
						dysregulation, anger/irritability, and difficulty sleeping (qtd. in Bennet 136). American Sniper
						makes sure to depict all of these clusters. Intrusive recollections are portrayed when Kyle stares
						at a blank TV in the living room, while explosions and gunfire is played in the background.
						Common avoidance symptoms are portrayed in several scenes when his wife Taya tries to talk to
						him, and he sits unresponsive and ignores her. Symptoms of negative mood swings are portrayed
						in the hospital scene, where Kyle is unreasonably panicked when seeing his baby daughter
						crying in hospital. Later on in the film, violent intrusion symptoms are shown during a family
						BBQ when Kyle misperceives a dog playing with a child, and aggressively hits and threatens the
						dog, to the horror of his onlooking family. This gives a very real and detailed look at intrusion
						symptoms and how they can lead to violence. In a study on PTSD symptoms, it was found that
						intrusion symptoms are the most dangerous and the most correlated to violent crime: “for each
						one unit increase in severity of intrusion symptoms reported, an individual's likelihood of being
						charged with a violent crime increases by 7% (139-140). This represents a very realistic look at
						the diversity of the symptoms and the progression of the condition. American Sniper shows
						reintegration and the costs of war in the most adulterated way. It's important that future
						depictions take note of this so the public understands that the condition is true and serious.
						<br /> <br />
						American Sniper sticks true to reality by depicting veterans' self perception as an obstacle
						to recovery and those around them as influencers to getting help. In the film, Kyle is portrayed as
						not accepting the seriousness of his mental health situation. He pretends he is fine, he tells the
						doctors he rationalizes the atrocities he saw on the battlefield, and he does not seek help until it is
						clear there is no other choice. Academics who have analyzed reintegration experiences have
						noted that this is very common: “Many who suffer from mental health problems do not perceive
						a need for help (18,22), and others grapple with uncertainty about whether their distress is severe
						enough to warrant it (26)” (Spoont, 660-661). Moreover, the film makes sure to to depict the
						role of Kyle’s physician at the hospital in introducing him to this recovery group, with which he
						eventually finds purpose and heals. The role his physician plays in the story lines up with real
						reintegration experiences. The results in the study conducted by Freyes et Al showed that: “All
						couples had reached out for professional help at some point postdeployment…To some extent,
						several couples credited their outcomes to the help or guidance received from professional
						sources. The only regret some expressed was not seeking help sooner” (153). This shows that
						getting professional help makes a big difference in the outcome, that most couples end up getting
						professional help, and that many wished they had sought help sooner. This is exactly what
						American Sniper depicts in Chris Kyle, and the fact it depicts it this way goes to show how far
						ahead the film is in showing the condition. What makes this particularly unique is that American
						Sniper is not primarily a film about mental health. It is a true war movie, with the gore,
						explosions, and combat scenes that get views, but it also finds the time to show this timeline that
						is incredibly realistic. For this, other depictions should take note.
						<br /> <br />
						American Sniper goes beyond other pop culture depictions of PTSD by depicting the
						condition in a neutral way and by showing the evolution of the condition over several
						deployments. As previously established, the vast majority of war films fall short when it comes
						to depicting PTSD. Out of those that do show it, many twist or misrepresent the condition for
						character development, and others depict the condition incorrectly. Not only does American
						Sniper depict it honestly, it also shows the impacts of war on Kyle’s mental health over several
						deployments and reintegration experiences, which gives an unparalleled look at the timeline of
						Kyle’s changing mental health. On his first return, his wife jumps into his arms as he walks off
						the plane onto the tarmac. The film makes it clear that all is well at first, but this does not last.
						On a later trip home, it is clear that Kyle is perturbed. He is more disillusioned, stressed, and the
						film shows his condition deteriorating by showing intrusions like the hospital scene where Kyle
						becomes unreasonably panicked and starts yelling at hospital staff when he sees his baby crying.
						On Kyle’s last trip home, the reality of his condition is obvious by looking at his relationship
						with his wife. On Kyle's last trip home, he does not tell his wife he is back, choosing instead to
						shelter at a bar until she calls him, asking where he is. The point is, no other depictions of PTSD
						are as detailed when it comes to showing the condition in its entirety, including the onset, the
						worsening of symptoms, the denial, and eventual recovery with professional help, family
						dialogue, and new coping mechanisms. What also sets American Sniper apart is that it remains
						neutral in this depiction. This is important because the Leiberman study found that neutral
						portrayals do as good or better than heroic portrayals of PTSD vets when it comes to shaping
						public perceptions in a positive way (10). Neutral portrayals are also beneficial because they are
						a lot more credible and realistic (11). This means that American Sniper leads a new wave in
						PTSD depictions by showing the condition honestly and in its entirety, while also making this
						nuanced and neutral portrayal stand out within a movie that also has all the classic elements of
						war like explosions and violence. This benefits vets and the public about what PTSD is like,
						what families go through, and why getting help is so important. By depicting the condition this
						way, American Sniper honors vets and others who have struggled with the condition, and makes
						great headway towards normalizing the condition and portraying it more positively. Other
						depictions should take note.
						<br /> <br />
						In conclusion, portrayals of war in pop culture are misleading and negatively influence
						the ways the public perceives veterans with mental health conditions. Moving forwards, the
						mental illnesses associated with combat should be a bigger part of the war stories that are told,
						and American Sniper makes great headway towards this goal. By honoring the condition and
						showing how brutal it is and how much it saps out of vets and their families, it does justice to
						them and their struggle, and it helps others by showing the struggle with PTSD is real and they
						are not alone.
