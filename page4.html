					<h3 style="margin:0;">Course Info</h3>
					<p> This course teaches the study of animal communication, the key terminology, the remarkable communicative systems that several animal species possess, and the key similarities and differences between human and non-human animals’ communications. The final project involves designing a study on a topic related to animal communication.</p>
					<h3 style="margin:0;">Introduction</h3>
					<p>
						Current research on dog marking behaviors has shown it is a dense medium for social
						interaction. Dogs are able to detect a wide array of each other’s physical features and have
						intricate marking and countermarking behaviors that change over time. Thus far, research has
						focused on how marking behaviors change with physical differences like breed, sex, age, and
						castration, as well as the chemical interactions beneath it all. Given how social this pathway for
						communication truly is, there is still more to be discovered about how it relates to face to face
						interactions, and whether these two pathways clash. In this 4 week longitudinal study,
						researchers will analyze how the amount of socialization impacts a dog’s interest in marking, as
						well as its interest in other dog’s marks. We hope to expand current research by understanding
						how these two areas of dog socialization interact, and we hope to give answers to pet parents
						who struggle to control marking behaviors about whether more, or less socialization can help.
					</p>
					<h3 style="margin:0;">Background</h3>
					<p>
						Scent marking is a type of olfactory communication which has been observed in several
						species in the animal kingdom. Scent marking involves animals leaving behind their scent on
						features in their environment to be detected by others at a later point in time. It is mainly used as
						a way of marking territory ownership, and it allows animals to detect each other in their absence

						(Gosling, L. M.,1982). Generally, olfactory communication allows species to identify
						characteristics about each other without needing to engage, which can work to avoid
						confrontation while allowing animals to discover features about each other. Domestic dogs are
						the most common example of this in our daily lives and have proven to be a flexible and
						convenient way for researchers to learn about scent marking.
						<br /><br />
						Researchers have observed scent marking behaviors in dogs of both sexes. Most studies
						have focused on how marking behaviors change based on mating and physical traits like sex,
						age, and whether they have been neutered/spayed (gondectamy). Early research established that
						males have higher rates of marking behaviors, and are more likely to direct their urine on
						specific targets (Anisco, 1973). Because of these findings, marking behaviors were more
						strongly associated with males dogs until further studies established that females also direct their
						urine and engage in scent marking behaviors (Wirant and McGuire, 2003). Researchers have also
						established that scent marking is an avenue for marking territory in both sexes, with males
						marking territory boundaries and females marking areas close to nests with their puppies (Pal,
						2003). This body of research indicates scent marking is important for both males and females.
						An area of interest has been how dog marking behaviors change with age. In a recent
						study, researchers found that older dogs urinate more frequently, and spend more time targeting
						their urine when they mark (McGuire, 2016). This almost indicates that it is a learned behavior
						and that dogs get better at it over time.
						<br /><br />
						Perhaps the most abundant area of research has been the effects of castration on marking
						behaviors. In a recent study, it was found castration was strongly correlated with decreased
						urination frequency in male dogs, but that it made no difference in female dogs (McGuire, 2018).
						This research confirms this behavior may be more prominent in male dogs, and that it is likely

						important to mating behaviors. A popular way of researching this is by testing how dogs react to
						the simulated marks of other dogs. By having dogs investigate different samples, and by
						measuring the amount of time that a dog spends investigating a particular scent, researchers have
						learned that dogs can detect a whole array of things, from sex, age, or even whether they are
						group mates. A study with beagles found that dogs can detect the sex, and heat cycle status of
						another dog (Dunbar, 1978). Research has also shown that dogs can detect whether the dog has
						been castrated. A study found that non castrated males and females elicited longer investigation
						than did urine from castrated sources (Lizberg and Snowdon, 2009).
						<br /><br />
						Given what researchers have learned, interest has been directed towards the chemical
						composition of dog urine to understand what underlays these behaviors. A series of studies have
						delved into the chemical relationships involved in marking behaviors. Researchers testing the
						association of creatine and cortisol with dog urination frequency during socialization found that
						there is a positive association between the two (Alberghina et al, 2019). Instead of analyzing
						urine compositions, other researchers have tried to directly alter urination behaviors using
						various drugs. In a study, researchers tested the effects of L-deprenyl, and found a decrease in
						directed sniffing, and a less frequent urination in males (Head and Milgram, 1992).
						<br /><br />
						Other studies have combined several of these areas of research and have looked at
						countermarking behaviors. Researchers found that males only overmarked intact males and not
						castrated ones, and had a preference to overmark non castrated females (Lizberg and Snowdon,
						2010). Research thus far shows marking behaviors are a dense social medium, and that it is
						important for dogs of all sexes, breeds, and ages.
					</p>
					<h3 style="margin:0;">Rationale</h3>
					<p>
						The current body of research teaches us a lot about how marking behaviors work, about
						the acute interactions between age, sex, gondectamny, and about how these interactions take
						place at the chemical level. Although this helps us understand marking behaviors, they do not do
						much to explain the relationship between marking and the social interactions dogs may have
						outside of times they may mark. As has been established, dogs can detect an incredible number
						of characteristics about other dogs, and scent marking is a much more dense pathway for
						information than we once thought. It's possible to think of this as a type of asynchronous
						communication, and it would be interesting to know how this pathway clashes with normal
						pathways of in-person interaction. The goal of this study is to understand if marking behaviors
						change based on a dog's socialization outside of times it may mark. This study seeks to answer
						whether dogs are more, or less inclined to engage in their habituistic marking behaviors based on
						outside levels of socialization. Thus far, it has not been made clear: It is possible that more
						socialization leads to more intensive marking behaviors due to an increased sense of competition,
						but it could also decrease interest in marking, since dogs may be tired of socializing with other
						dogs.
						<br /><br />
						The previous body of research proves that dog marking is incredibly social. Dogs can
						detect different features about each other, and have very developed and intricate behaviors for
						marking and countermarking. Researchers have also found that dogs can detect urine of familiar
						versus unfamiliar dogs. In a study, “Male Dogs spent nearly twice as much time investigating
						urine from other males in the colony and over four times longer investigating urine from a
						stranger as they did investigating their own urine” (Dunbar and Carmichael, 1981). Along with
						this, studies have shown that dogs are able to detect their conspecifics versus unfamiliar dogs.

						This indicates that there may be a decreased need for dogs to investigate the urine of dogs they
						socialize with. This indicates that socialization might actually decrease marking behaviors, since
						social dogs may feel less of a need to mark.
						<br /> <br />
						Beyond expanding our understanding of socialization and marking behaviors, this area of
						research is particularly important for many dog parents who are challenged to curb or manage
						the behavior. As researchers have established, marking is a natural behavior, and it is not a
						problem the majority of the time. Sometimes however, dogs will mark indoors, or on things they
						should not be marking on. Curbing and reducing the marking behaviors is important to dog
						owners, and a lot of content exists to advise dog owners on what to do, ranging from getting your
						dog neutered to using certain enzymatic cleaners. This study could help these pet parents by
						looking for any connections between socialization and reduction of marking behaviors. If your
						dog marks when it shouldn’t, maybe giving it more, or less socialization could help.

					</p>
					<h3 style="margin:0;">Methods</h3>
					<p>
						To conduct this longitudinal study, the research team will work with local animal shelters
						to select 10 dogs whose adoptions will be delayed for the study and whose social schedules can
						be determined entirely by the research team. To elaborate, visits by potential adopters will
						continue normally, but the pickup date, or date of ownership, will not be until the study ends.
						Five of the dogs will be males and five of the dogs will be females. Previous research has shown
						that castration tends to reduce marking behaviors, so for the purposes of collecting more data,
						none of the selected dogs will be castrated. Since this is a repeated measures design, and dogs of
						all ages and breeds engage in marking behaviors, researchers will be selecting an even spread of
						these based on availability. Once dogs are selected based on these factors, the last part of the
						selection process will involve researchers confirming that each dog does, in fact, engage in
						marking behaviors by taking them on a walk.
						<br /> <br />
						Working with local animal shelters provides several advantages. First, most shelters
						appreciate the help. Taking the time to exercise and socialize rescue dogs can be arduous and it's
						nice to lift a weight off the shoulders of volunteers. From personal experience, most shelter dogs
						are housed in separate enclosures for health and safety reasons. This is done mostly to avoid
						fights and to stop the transmission of any potential illnesses or diseases, since the dog’s histories
						are not usually known. This benefits our study by reducing the potential biases that come with
						dogs who have already been adopted, since they tend to live in much less consistent
						environments. Lastly, although this is from personal experience and it likely varies, shelter dogs
						usually spend about a month at the shelter or pound before they are adopted. This study is
						designed to fit in that timeframe to avoid too much disruption to the shelter’s adoption process.
						To ease any burden, the research team will also make a financial contribution to the shelter(s) to
						pay all the expenses, for each dog, during their entire shelter stay.
						<br /><br />
						The 10 selected dogs will engage in an experiment with repeated measures design. This is
						advantageous because it requires a small sample, putting less load on shelters and logistics. It
						also helps to eliminate the many, many confounding factors that impact dog marking behaviors
						mentioned previously. This experiment will consist of two trial conditions, a “socialized”
						condition and a “exercise” condition. In the “socialized” condition, dogs will engage in one hour
						of social interaction at a local dog park preselected for this experiment. During this time, the
						experimenter will record all dog marking behaviors, and record the types, and numbers of social
						interactions the dog has. The second condition is the “exercise condition” where dogs engage in
						an hour of solo exercise and playtime with an experimenter in a large, open area, but without the
						presence of other dogs. This allows the dogs to get an equal amount of physical exercise in both
						conditions, with only the level of social interaction being different. Put simply, every dog will get
						either 1 hour of playtime with other dogs, or 1 hour of playtime with the experimenter, each day.
						The 10 dogs will be split into two groups, A, and B for counterbalancing. Group A will be
						exposed to the ‘socialized’ condition for two weeks, then be exposed to the “exercise” condition
						for two weeks. Group B dogs will experience the conditions in the reverse order.
						<br /><br />
						Along with either the hour of social time, or the hour of exercise, researchers will take
						each dog for a 30 minute walk along a pre chosen path for the dog which remains the same
						across both conditions. The experimenter will video record the dog walk, and note the number of
						times the dog marks. This is purely to understand whether the dogs mark at higher rates.
						<br /> <br />
						At a chosen point in the day for each dog, a researcher will take the dog through a urine
						course mimicking the one used by Lisberg and Snowdon in their 2009 study. Working with the
						shelter, researchers will collect 25 urine samples from various dogs. A urine course will be
						created each day in a consistent place for each dog. The urine course contains 6 wooden stakes
						placed 10 feet apart in a line, aligned perpendicular to the wind. Three of the stakes have urine
						samples from other dogs, and three of the stakes have tap water as a control. Each day, the stakes
						are randomized such that the control, and urine samples were in each ‘stake’ position at least
						once during the study. The researcher is to guide the leased dog through the urine course, and
						video tapes the process. Just like in the Lisberg and Snowdon study, researchers are to stop
						within 3 feet of each stake, and move on after 30 seconds unless the dog was still investigating.
						The researchers are not to engage in any communication and are to refrain from eye contact, and
						should do their best to maintain a loose leash.
						<br /><br />
						As with any study, there are certain limitations. This study was designed to fit into a
						month, with each trial condition lasting two weeks. It must be stated that the trial conditions
						could have much more significant effects if the study were prolonged. This study can be seen as
						a pilot study, and further ones could be extended. Additionally, the results may be affected by the
						amount of time that passes between the “socialized” and “exercise” conditions, up until the urine
						course and dog walk are performed. It is possible that the longer you wait after socialization,
						even if a matter of hours, the more time a dog will spend investigating other urines. Another
						experiment would have to be run to figure this out. Lastly, it must be stated that for the 30 minute
						daily walks, there is a lot of variability in the smells and environmental cues that a dog may
						encounter, and researchers will not be able to tell if a dog is seeking out the smells of other dogs,
						or some kind of food, or prey. Accounting for these is practically very difficult, and could be the
						topic of a future study.
						<br /><br />
					</p>
					<h3 style="margin:0;">Predictions</h3>
					<p>
						I predict that dogs who go to the dog park will be less likely to engage in marking
						behaviors during the walks and will spend less time investigating the samples of other dog’s
						urines in the urine course. An important point to note is that dog marking is natural, and has a
						territorial element which this study does not eliminate. Therefore, I definitely do not expect
						marking behaviors to drop to zero, instead, I expect a decrease of significant proportions.
						Fundamentally, I think the processes of socialization and marking behaviors are related. Previous
						studies have shown that dogs who socialize spend less time smelling familiar urines. I think dogs
						use scent marking as a second avenue for socialization, and that they'll be less interested in using
						this avenue of communication when they have more time to pursue primary avenues for
						socializing with other dogs.

					<p>
						My predictions about the total number of marks are illustrated in figure 1, which shows predicted
						results for a group A dog. Since I expect socialization to decrease dog marking behaviors, I
						expect to see an increase once socialization stops, as I expect the dog will resort to scent marking
						to reach its conspecifics. For this specific group A subject, Dog 1, I expect to see an increase in marking behaviors once socialization stops. It must be noted, the significance of the increase
						may be a lot less and may change substantially from dog to dog.

					<span class="image main" style="text-align: -webkit-center;"><img style="width: 60%; display: block; margin-right: 2em; padding: 1em;" src="images/articles/pee1.JPG" alt="" /></span>
					<p>
						Figure 2 shows a graph of predicted results for the urine course. I expect that over time, a
						lack of social interaction will push this particular dog to be more interested in marking behaviors
						as an outlet for socialization, and the dog therefore will spend more time investigating samples in
						the urine course. I also predict that the order of the trials may have an effect on the results. The
						dogs that spend two weeks socializing, then two weeks without social interaction may show a
						more dramatic tendency to mark, or investigate other marks than vice versa.
