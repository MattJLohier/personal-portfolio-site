					<br />
					<h3 style="margin:0;">Background</h3>
					<p>  This course follows up on design skills taught in COGS 187A. Students  probe more deeply into selective topics, such as animation, navigation, graphical display of information, and narrative coherence. Final project involved a quarter long redesign with real life client <i>Spa de Esperanza</i>.  </p>
					<p> In this project, my team and I: </p>
					<ul>
						<li> Cold called and networked to find a project to redesign  </li>
						<li>
							Worked with client to establish business priorities and objectives
						</li>
						<li>
							Conducted user research by gathering demographic information and conducting interviews
						</li>
						<li> Created personas based on user research, then generated scenarios, use cases, and a functionality table to guide our redesign</li>
						<li> Did a competive analysis looking at other brands functionality, site architecture, and content to understand what we should use in our redesign</li>
						<li>
							Wrote a creative brief that explains our motivations, objectives, audience, and more.
						</li>
						<li>
							Created wireframes and a page layout for our redesign
						</li>
						<li>
							Conducted Usability testing and leveraged feedback from other teams to make usability improvements
						</li>
						<li>
							Worked closely with our client throughout the 10 week project and presented our final prototype at the end
						</li>
					</ul>

					<h3 style="margin:0;">Client and Requirements Gathering</h3>
					<p>
						Our First task was to identify a potential client to work with for our project. We started off by
						identifying potential clients and we narrowed our target down to small businesses with an online presence.
						We had one week to network, cold call, and send emails. Out of our potential clients, we chose Spa De Esperanza, a Spa in the Bay Area, California that sells facials, cosmetics,
						and other skincare products and services. Spa de Esperanza is run by Kristina Shapona-Rodriguez, who acted as our liason to the company.

						<br /><br />

						After finding our client, we had to figure out her needs and requirements. We meet with Kristina and she explained the current direction of her company and what her website could do better.
						We learned that Kristina was not looking to expand her in-person clientele with her website, but rather strengthen her
						online client base. To this end, she expressed wanting to do Zoom facials or create blogs or
						educational videos to teach clients how to take better care of themselves. Kristina mentioned the limitations of her in person business
						like the challenges of training new staff, and reinterated the importance of building out her online store for asthetics and usability.
						Based on this information, we generated a priority list with 10 action items we would focus on along the course of our redesign.
					</p>
					<p> <b> Priority List </b></p>
					<ul>
						<li> Streamline the click and buy process for cosmetics.</li>
						<li>
							Focus on developing the online business, specifically the zoom facials and cosmetic
							sales
						</li>
						<li>
							Make the website more usable for older customers, while keeping it fresh for
							younger ones. Targeting a middle ground of 30+
						</li>
						<li>
							Show of the brand’s blend between an integrity of science and natural and holistic
							options
						</li>
						<li>
							Show off education as an important part of the website and brand. Its more than
							just a service, it teaches you how to take care of yourself.

						</li>
						<li>
							Convey how personalized and wholistic the brand is. It is a relationship with the
							customer, much more than just a service.
						</li>
						<li>
							Market the membership option to improve sales
						</li>
						<li>
							Show of the credibility of the brand, the research behind the cosmetics, and the
							brand’s clinical aspect
						</li>
						<li>
							Prototype new color palette and logo options
						</li>
						<li>
							Generally declutter and make the site a bit easier to read. Make it more usable and
							intuitive.
						</li>
					</ul>
					<hr />

					<h3 style="margin:0;">User Research and Interviews</h3>
					<span class="image main"><img style="width: 30%; display: block; float: right; margin-right: 2em; padding: 1em;" src="images/articles/spa5.JPG" alt="" /></span>
					<p>
						The first step in our redesign is to understand our client base and the people who are actually using the site.
						We gathered information from our client about the demographics of her clients and got information about several who would be willing to meet with us.
						We began by creating an interview guide to understand our clients.
						This included:
						<ul>
							<li> General Demographic Questions</li>
							<li> Spa Experience Questions</li>
							<li> Skincare Knowledge Questions</li>
							<li> Website / Online Store Questions </li>
						</ul>
						We then interviewing 11 different clients and potential customers to understand how they use, or would use Spa De Esperanza's website.
						We started by building out persona types based on the information our client gave us about her customer base.
						<ul>
							<li> The in-person Customer</li>
							<li> The DIY customer </li>
							<li> The Online Shopper</li>
						</ul>
					</p>
					<span class="image main"><img style="width: 28%; display: block; float: right; margin-right: 2em; padding: 1em;" src="images/articles/spa4.JPG" alt="" /></span>

					<p style="margin-bottom:0;">
						Next, we built out 3 detailed scenarios and 15 use cases for each of the personas. The goal is to understand common problems and client use cases to refine our redesign.
						For example, for the in-person customer:
						<br /><br />
						<b> Scenario 1: </b>JM, a local resident, heard about Spa de Esperanza from her
						friend who knows Kristina personally. She is mainly interested in anti-aging
						facials and products and would like to book a first time consultation at Spa de
						Esperanza.
						<br /><br />
						<b> Scenario 2: </b>MW had an appointment for an upcoming monthly facial but has
						a scheduling conflict due to a family emergency. His appointment is in two
						days and needs to reschedule to sometime next week. He needs to check on
						the availability of his staff member and if the services he needs are available
						for that day.
						<br /><br />
						<b> Scenario 3: </b>BK is a 30+ woman who wants to book a facial for herself and a
						group of her friends from Church. They are looking for group facials with
						services that cater towards anti-aging
					</p>
					<span class="image main" style="margin:0;"><img style="width: 32%; display: block; float: left; margin-right: 2em; padding: 1em;" src="images/articles/spa6.JPG" alt="" /></span>
					<p style="margin-top:3em;">
						We then compiled all of the different use cases to generate a use case summary table. This helps us understand which features
						are used the most, and which features we should prioritize in our redesign. From there, we built a feature and functionality table which breaks down the feature demanded
						for each type of client. Since our client wants to focus on the online customer base, this helps us understand what features and functionalties we should expand.
					</p>
					<br /><br />

					<h3 style="margin:0;">Competitive Analysis and Mood Board</h3>
					<span class="image main" style="margin: 0; text-align: -webkit-center;"><img style="width: 70%; display: block; margin-right: 2em; padding: 1em;" src="images/articles/spa7.JPG" alt="" /></span>
					<p>
						Next we researched Spa De Esperanza's competitors. We searched for competitors in the Bay area, San Diego, Los Angeles, and ones that operated nationally. The five
						companies above were the ones we ended up doing an analysis on. We chose the Drunk Elephant and Wholy Dose because
						of their refined beauty-products online stores. We chose Spa Belles, Yoso, and Angelica B Beauty because they’re all spas
						similar in nature to Spa De Esperanza and have relatively clean and well organized websites. Overall, we focused on sites
						with online stores or blogs to address our client’s main wants from our initial interview
					</p>
					<p> For each competitor, we conducted an in-depth analysis of their Brand, Functionality, Site Architecture, and Content. Based on our research, we compiled action items for our redesign</p>
					<p> First, we looked at competitor branding. We looked at designs, key words, color pallette, brand terms, and more for each competitor</p>

					</div>
					<p> Then we looked at each competitor's site functionalities. We created a list of key functionalities, features, and all dynamic content </p>
					<div style="display:flex;">

					</div>
					<p> Then we looked at each competitor's navigation design and compiled a detailed list of all the primary labels on each competitor site </p>
					<div style="display:flex;">

					<p> Lastly, we researched our competitor's content to understand the full range of content possibilities and how they are presented </p>
					<div style="display:flex;">

						bottom will be a journal which will contain articles both internal
						and external linked to topics of the clients choosing.
					</p>
					<p style="margin:0em;"> About Us </p>
					<p>
						In line with most competitors there will be an image of the client
						and team with a values statement below. This will provide insight
						into what about the clients branding, values and history sets them
						apart. Below this will be a FAQ’s section and company information
						below.
					</p>
					<p style="margin:0em;"> <b> Audience</b></p>
					<p style="margin:0em;"> Primary Audience: Skincare DIY-er</p>
					<p>
						The “skincare DIY-er” is most likely a 25-60 year old woman looking to educate
						themselves on proper skin care practices and carry out the routines on their own.
						Their reason for sticking to at-home independent care can range all the way from
						COVID concerns to simply not being a fan of the in-person spa experience. What this
						audience needs from the website are easy to follow video tutorials (best case:
						hands-free) and helpful articles regarding skin care practices or recommendations
						from specialists. Ideally, the site can contain something like a skin-type questionnaire
						and product recommendation list to maintain Spa de Esperanza’s devotion to
						personalized skincare. We will target this audience by highlighting Spa de Esperanza’s
						journal / blog on the home screen as well as advertising video tutorials wherever
						applicable (services, shop, etc).
					</p>
					<p style="margin:0em;"> Secondary Audience: Online Shopper</p>
					<p>
						The online shopper is an individual who is simply visiting the site to purchase
						products. This person is looking for product recommendations and an intuitive shop
						layout. Their reasons for shopping can include searching for a gift all the way to
						looking for products manufactured to cater to their already known skin care type. For
						this reason, the filtering / sorting capabilities of the online store should be powerful
						but generalizable such that it can service this diverse audience’s needs. Furthermore,
						this audience is probably already familiar with giant online stores such as Sephora or
						Amazon who are able to sell products usually at a much lower price. This may make
						memberships or loyalty programs a necessity to compete for their wallets. Lastly, the
						mobile port of Spa De Esperanza’s store must be mobile-friendly as many online
						shoppers do their shopping solely on their phones.
					</p>
					<p style="margin:0em;"> Tertiary Audience: In person customer</p>
					<p>
						The in-person spa goer is an individual that is visiting the website simply to check
						business hours, location, contact, and most importantly, book their appointments
						online. Though the age range varies greatly, it’s important to note that in-person spa
						goers will contain the subgroup of elderly customers who are generally unable to
						interact with Spa de Esperanza through online facets. That being said, the in-person
						spa-goer usually goes to a spa to relax, get professional help for their skin care, or for
						a day out with friends /family. Since more people are moving away from calling in to
						make appointments, it’s essential that the online booking system on the site is intuitive and easy to use. Especially considering that the elderly subgroup of
						customers are some of the main in-person spa goers. It should be noted that the
						website needs to strike a good balance between this division of online / in-person
						customers. Booking should be made readily apparent to in-person goers, but
						shouldn’t be so overbearing such that it frustrates the DIY-er’s or online shoppers.
					</p>
					<p style="margin:0;"> <b> Objectives</b></p>
					<p style="margin:0em;"> Client Objectives</p>
					<p>
						Our client’s primary objective is to invigorate and expand her online client base. As the
						business’ primary esthetician and as a busy mother of five, it is challenging for her to
						keep up with in person demand. Hiring and training new staff is expensive and time
						consuming and does not fit her business model. To achieve this primary objective,
						three secondary objectives must be pursued. First, the website needs a redesigned
						product shopping interface to make it more competitive for new clients. Second, the
						site needs to do a better job of selling and promoting the zoom facials and DIY kits.
						Lastly, the site needs to be more on the educational aspect of her brand by sharing
						teaching manuals for estheticians or clients themselves. At the tertiary level, our
						client would like her site to sell per special services like wedding treatments and
						cancer skin packages. She would also like to share the brand’s holistic approach, and
						its focus on developing long term treatments for its clients which work.
					<p style="margin:0em;"> User Objectives</p>
					<p>
						Spa de Esperanza’s clients want a seamless and integrated online experience that feels
						purposeful, practical, and that guides them to what they are looking for. Clients don’t
						want sites that feel empty, cluttered, or that lack direction. Clients want to be able to
						easily understand the differences between various online and in-person services, they
						want an easy booking experience, and they want to understand the professionalism of
						the care they are getting. Online clients want transparency around the DIY and zoom
						facial process. They want to be able to understand the different online product
						options, how virtual consultations work, how DIY kits are tailored for them, and they
						want instructions and tutorials to be simple enough for them to do . Those that are
						mainly using the online shop want a decluttered interface that easily helps them find
						products and that is very visual to break down product categories. Finally, all repeat
						customers want to learn about loyalty benefits, memberships, and current sales.
					</p>
					<p style="margin:0;"> <b> Personality and Tone</b></p>
					<p>
						By reviewing the previous survey of Spa de Esperanza, and the feedback from our
						client on the competitive analysis and mood board, we summarized three main
						impressions of the brand.
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>
							Firstly, our client is a cancer survivor, so she hopes to help
							the customers' health through her professional knowledge and positive attitude.
						</li>
						<li>
							Secondly, customers can not only buy products or book services through the website,
							but also learn new knowledge
						</li>
						<li>
							Third, the brand combines ancient philosophy and
							modern science
						</li>
					</ul>

					<p>
						Therefore, we hope to match the brand's concept of "Bring the
						integrity of science and holistic therapy to serve the customer’s skin care and life in
						general" by adding the following functions:
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>
							The whole website style should be clean,simple and elegant, which is
							also convenient for browsing and operation at all groups of age.
						</li>
						<li>
							Carefully selected graphics and photos will not be boring or bulky.
						</li>
						<li>
							The writing style is simple and easy to understand, and there will be no
							big paragraphs.
						</li>
						<li>
							Reclassify web pages to make users have a smoother browsing
							experience.
						</li>
					</ul>

					<h3 style="margin:0;"> Critiques</h3>
					<p>
						The next part of our project involved running some usability tests on our prototype to identify any weaknesses or things that are missing.
						We held usability sessions with other groups in the class and compiled their feedback.
					</p>
					<p style="margin:0;"> <b>Changes we will make  </b></p>
					<ol>
						<li>Change the font color on the services page to a more visible one </li>
						<li> Shrink the size of several elements on the services page</li>
						<li>
							Create and standardize the back buttons used
						</li>
						<li> Add more back button functionality to the shop / services flow</li>
						<li>
							Remove the arrow on the carousels and indicate in some other fashion that they are
							scrollable
						</li>
						<li> Add more white space to the margins of images on the blog / services page</li>
						<li> Standardize the header size on the services page</li>
						<li>
							Fix the functional elements pointed out by team 19 (broken home buttons, large button
							click radius)
						</li>
					</ol>
					<p style="margin:0;"> <b> Reasoning</b></p>
					<p>
						Overall, we agreed with most of the critiques we got or simply thought that they were
						necessary to the functionality of the product. The broken functional elements for example (8)
						were something that we must fix and were simply overlooked by the team in our rush to finish
						the prototype. As for the font color (change 1) our group was somewhat torn on whether the text
						was sufficiently visible but eventually agreed to change it after remembering our client’s sizable
						elderly customer base. They were actually the reason motivating our “zoomed in” aesthetic
						(change 2) but upon running through our desktop site with team 10, we realized that we had
						definitely gone a little too far with the sizing. Moving to change 3, we decided to standardize the
						back button because it’s good practice to keep UI elements predictable for the sake of ease of
						use and visual consistency. This same logic is what motivated us to also adopt the changes
						suggested by change 7. Change 4 was something not necessarily touched upon on our critiques
						but something we noticed as members of team 10 were going through our site

					<h3 style="margin:0;">Reflection</h3>
					<p>
						I’m happy with our redesign and feel that our final project is a big improvement over Kristina’s current site. Although it leaves a bit
						to be desired in the looks department, I think we did very well considering just how big the site is. This project taught me that it is hard to
						incorporate everyone’s creative visions in a way that looks cohesive and that delegates work in a fair manner. I also learned that creating
						elements that are visually appealing for the web is very challenging, and it’s easy to get locked into a design idea without thinking out of
						the box. I also got a lot better at writing professional emails while keeping regular contact with our client, sending our deliverables, and
						letting them know of our needs ahead of time.
					</p>
					<hr />
					<h3 style="margin:0;">What I learned</h3>
					<p>
						I leared a ton about figma prototyping, about usability testing, about working on a team and coordinating projects with a real life client. The deadlines
						were also quite aggressive, which gave this project a real life feel.
					</p>

					<h3 style="margin:0;">Instructor Feedback</h3>
					<p>
						<i>This is an aesthetically pleasing and ambitious design that showcases the clients' products and services well. We can see how much this design has improved over the weeks and we're very impressed with the way that you have responded to feedback. However, there were several lingering usability issues which impacted the design, in particular the shop filtering, and the interactivity. Overall great job. </i>
